A Limpopo woman won R600 000 on Supa Bet and bought her unemployed ex boyfriend a brand new Golf 7 GTI to win his heart back.According to the lady who identified herself as Mapula Ramoshaba from Zebediela, she bought the car for her ex boyfriend who dumped her for another woman to show she loves him. I love my man. That woman used muthi to win him over. When I won Supa Bet I bought him something he always wanted. He is back now and we are happy. Money is nothing when you are not happy, said the 25 year old woman.Ramoshaba s mother kicked her out of her two-roomed house when she learned of the Vrrrr Phaaa purchase. I can t believe my daughter acted so stupidly. We don t have a decent house but she spent half a million on a no good unemployed guy who doesn t even care about her, said angry mother. He left her for another woman and she attempted to commit suicide. When she won the money he came back running and she bought him an expensive car. I kicked her out of my house, she added.When we visited the man he was playing Black Motion s Imali inside the car. He told us he didn t have anything to say to us.
