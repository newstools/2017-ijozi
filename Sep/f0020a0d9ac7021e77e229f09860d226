SEX with my blesser is off the scale the first time it has ever been like that for me and I want to tell his wife we re together.I m 31. I had a succession of boyfriends through my teens, twenties and now thirties and the sex was always rubbish.My lover is the only person who has ever made me orgasmI never wanted things to progress with any of these men because I kept thinking something was lacking.I reinvented myself three years ago. I retrained as cabin crew for a budget airline, I had a new image and made new friends.One of the single girls who worked with me through training was a dating website fanatic. She helped me create my profile one evening over a bottle of wine.A guy messaged me who said he was 59 and he looked lovely. He admitted he was married and just looking for some fun. We chatted for a couple of weeks and then met up when I had a few days off.He took me out for dinner and we just got on so well. Our conversation turned sexual and I must admit I was pretty turned on. He suggested we go back to my place.We kissed passionately once inside the door. He said: Show me your bedroom. We went upstairs and the kissing continued until he peeled off my clothes and I took off his. He was in great shape for a man his age.We had sex. He really knew what he was doing and I experienced my first ever orgasm with a guy. It felt incredible. I couldn t get enough of him.He explained that he s weak-willed he can t leave his wife as she would be devastated and he doesn t want to lose his comfortable, easy lifestyle.He admitted to having no physical intimacy with her, not even a hug, after 20 years of marriage. We meet every week for sex, but he isn t a player. He s only ever been with his wife and me. Am I wasting my time?
