In his latest bid he claimed to have undergone an operation and was informed by his doctor to not participate in any strenuous activities including having business meetings.Contacted for comment Motsoeneng said he has not yet been informed about the outcomes of the disciplinary hearing and he would only be in a position to comment once he has documents in front of him.&#8220;What are you implying by today? I&#8217;m always okay. I can&#8217;t comment on that because I don&#8217;t have the information in front of me. Up until I get the papers I can&#8217;t comment. You are very lucky mshana because you were able to get information before me. I need to read the papers and apply my mind so how do I apply my mind if I don&#8217;t have the papers in front of me &#8221; said Motsoeneng.
