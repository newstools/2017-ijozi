Maponyane was found guilty of assaulting his then wife Sylvia Maponyane by the Tembisa Magistrate&#8217;s Court on Friday.The SABC Sports commentator was fined R3000 or six months imprisonment and a further R6000 or 24 months imprisonment which was wholly suspended for 24 months.The former Kaizer Chiefs striker, who pleaded guilty to the charge, couldn&#8217;t be reached for comment at the time of going to press.NPA spokeswoman Phindi Mjonondwana confirmed Maponyane was found guilty of assault with intent to do grievous bodily harm for moering his wife.&#8220;He pleaded guilty to assaulting his wife and was found guilty and given a suspended sentence,&#8221; she said.Mjonondwana said the sentence would serve as a deterrent to would-be wife beaters and also send a strong message to society that such behaviour is punishable by law.&#8220;It is also a victory for all the women in the country, anyone who perpetuates violence against women will incur the full wrath of the law irrespective of their social standing in society. We want to thank the police, the prosecutor and the magistrate who worked on the case for the sterling work they have done,&#8221; she said.Sylvia said she felt numb about her ex-husband&#8217;s conviction.&#8220;The whole thing just makes me numb as I didn&#8217;t expect it to reach the stage it did. We have been together for 39 years and for the whole thing to just end like this really makes me feel numb. I have not even told the kids about this,&#8221; she said.She said although Maponyane pleaded guilty to assaulting her, he didn&#8217;t apologise to her after the court proceedings.Sylvia opened a case of assault last year after he assaulted her in one of their domestic violence incidents at their marital home in Midstream Estate near Centurion.She said they were arguing about Maponyane&#8217;s alleged infidelity in their bedroom when he lost his cool and hit her in the face with a hanger.&#8220;He pleaded guilty to assaulting his wife and was found guilty and given a suspended sentence,&#8221; she said.
