There was drama in Seshego Township on Monday morning when a married male pastor was caught bonking a fellow married congregant in her matrimonial bed. Pastor Eliem Mukhade of Light of World Ministries was caught by the woman s husband following a tip from neighbors, the two where later thrown to the streets naked. The husband to the cheating wife said that he received a tip off yesterday in the evening and had to travel from Johannesburg where he works as a security guard. This is a shock of my life, a received a whatsapp text from Mnthoe (referring to the neighbor) that I should come home immediately as he suspected that my wife was hosting a man in our matrimonial house. I arrived here at exactly 06:30 am, I used the spare key that I had to unlock the main door and moved swiftly only to catch them red handed having intercourse, he said.The man ascertained that he no longer have anything to do with his wife. He blames her for misfortunes that he had encountered since their marriage, including their inability to have a child. When I married her, I was someone in this township, I managed to buy this house when I was single but because of her, everything turned against my way. It s been 6 years in marriage but look, we don t have kids, it s because of her prostitution deeds. Now I want to shame them by throwing them outside naked. I was told that this man is a Pastor, he is definitely a fake pastor. His congregants have to know that their pastor is a fornicator. The commotion of the naked two drew attention from the police who later said, prostitution has no place in our law and humiliating people to the extent of throwing them out naked was inhumane.
